Steps:
1. before every experiment set parallelism in the following files:

==> load-balance-skew-word-count.properties
parallelism=5
source-parallelism=1

generators.1.op.dist.bound=5
# make sure the following has $parallelism values.
generators.1.op.dist.weights=1,2,2,2,4

==> environment.sh
# make sure it is equal to $source-parallelism
N_PARTITIONS=1
